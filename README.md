- **2 Key**: Switch to Intermediate level
- **3 Key**: Switch to Expert level

### üìä Game Information

- Real-time mine counter

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher
- Git

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ebiten-tour.git
cd ebiten-tour

# Download dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the game
go build -o minesweeper

# Run the game
./minesweeper
```

### Quick Run

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Clear all cells that don't contain mines
2. **Numbers**: Show count of mines in adjacent 8 cells
3. **Flags**: Right-click to mark suspected mine locations
4. **First Click**: Always safe - no mine in clicked cell or surrounding area
5. **Chain Reaction**: Clicking empty cell (0 adjacent mines) opens all connected empty areas
6. **Win Condition**: Open all non-mine cells
7. **Lose Condition**: Click on a mine

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Single-file design**: Simple, self-contained implementation
- **Dynamic sizing**: All game logic adapts to different grid dimensions
- **Responsive UI**: Header layout adjusts to window width
- **Custom graphics**: Hand-drawn mine and number displays

### Performance

- **60 FPS rendering**: Smooth gameplay experience
- **Efficient drawing**: Vector-based graphics for crisp display
- **Memory optimized**: Dynamic board allocation per difficulty

### Dependencies

- [Ebiten v2.8.8](https://ebiten.org/) - 2D game engine
- Go standard library

## Development

### Code Formatting

```bash
gofmt -w .
```
